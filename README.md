# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Offline Dataset)

This notebook performs sentiment analysis on a set of pre-downloaded tweets. Due to Twitter API restrictions, the dataset is static, but the pipeline demonstrates:

- Cleaning tweet text using regex (punctuation, contractions, slang)
- Removing hashtags and symbols
- Calculating sentiment polarity using rule-based logic
- Outputting cleaned tweets and their associated sentiment scores

> Originally built as a course assignment exploring real-world NLP cleanup techniques.

## 🔧 Tech Used
- Python (pandas, regex)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Highlights
- Handles apostrophe expansion and informal speech patterns
- Implements basic polarity scoring
- Demonstrates pre- vs. post-cleaning tweet output
